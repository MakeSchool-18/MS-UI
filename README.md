# Custom Views

A couple simple classes to easily add borders and corner radius to UI elements. 

There are three custom classes in this example project:

- CustomButton
- CustomImageView
- CustomView

## @IBInspectible

These classes use @IBInspectible to add properties that can be set using the property inspector in storyboard. 

## @IBDesignable

The classes also make use of @IBDesignable which allows them to draw the borders in storyboard. 
This allows you to easily see the effects of setting these properties while you work. 

### NOTE: There is also an `CustomLabel` class. Which is not working correctly at the moment.
